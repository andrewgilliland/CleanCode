# üé® Formatting

Uncle Bob likes his code clean and his ____ dirty. (fill in the blank)

"...a scrambled mass of code that looks like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors.."

These are just code formatting ideas, and I won't die on a hill for any of them.

## The Purpose of Formatting

The purpose is readability. Readability affects maintainability and extensibility

## Vertical Formatting

Smaller files are usually easier to understand than a large files. Shoot for 200-500 lines max.

### The Newspaper Metaphor

Code files should be read from the top down. File names should be simple but explanatory, the names (plus directory structure) should let us know if we are in the right module.

### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

### Vertical Density

### Vertical Distance

#### Variable Declaration

#### Instance variables

#### Dependent Functions

#### Conceptual Affinity

### Vertical Ordering

## Horizontal Formatting

Keep your lines short. Keep them to a max of length of 100 to 120 characters. Your should never have to scroll to the right.

### Horizontal Openness and Density

Horizontal white space can be used for associating things that strongly related.

With assignment statement, have a space between the left side and the right side.

```php
// bad
$array=[1,2,3,4];

// good
$array = [4,5,6,7];
```

Since functions and arguments are closely, there are no spaces between the function name and opening parenthesis

```php
```

### Horizontal Alignment

### Indentation

#### Breaking Indentation

### Dummy Scopes

## Team Rules

Keep it consistent. I don't care if you put an üçÜ at the end of each line, as long as it's consistent.

Automate is as much as possible. Pick tools that best suite your needs for you language and build them into your workflow.

## But What About Markup?

But Uncle Bob, you didn't talk about formating markup (HTML, XML, Markdown, etc). Keep it simple, endent nested elements into others.

```html
<div>
    <section>
        <div>
            <h2>This is a Heading</h2>
            <div>This is a description of a thing. Use your imagination</div>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>The next section</h2>  
    </section>
</div>
```

## Formatting vs Linting

Formatting ensures code looks clean and follows consistent style rules, and linting checks code for errors and potential bugs.

### Formatting

Formatting is about how your code looks. It's focus is on the style, not the correctness.

Formatting should:

- Fix indentation
- Adds/removes spaces or line breaks
- Order imports
- Enforces consistent styling

Formatting tools:

- PHP: PHP-CS-Fixer (PSR-12), Prettier (with PHP plugin)
- JavaScript: Prettier

Note: Prettier is a formatter that supports these file types out of the box:

- HTML
- CSS, Less, and SCSS
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- JSON
- YAML
- Markdown and MDX
- JSX
- Angular
- Vue
- GraphQL
- Flow
- Ember/Handlebars


### Linting

Linting is about finding problems in your code. Both syntactic (missing brackets, etc.) and semantics (unused variables, deprecated functions, etc.).

Linting should:

- Detect errors, warnings, or code smells
- Enforces coding standards or best practices
- Helps prevent bugs and maintain code quality.

Linting tools:

- PHP: php -l, PHPStan
- JavaScript: ESLint
