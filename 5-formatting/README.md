# ðŸ§¹ Formatting

"...a scrambled mass of code that looks like it was written by a bevy of drunken sailors.."

## The Purpose of Formatting

## Vertical Formatting

### The Newspaper Metaphor

### Vertical Openness Between Concepts

### Vertical Density

### Vertical Distance

#### Variable Declaration

#### Instance variables

#### Dependent Functions

#### Conceptual Affinity

### Vertical Ordering

## Horizontal Formatting

Keep your lines short. Keep them to a max of length of 100 to 120 characters. Your should never have to scroll to the right.

### Horizontal Openness and Density

Horizontal white space can be used for associating things that strongly related.

With assignment statement, have a space between the left side and the right side.

```php
// bad
$array=[1,2,3,4];

// good
$array = [4,5,6,7];
```

Since functions and arguments are closely, there are no spaces between the function name and opening parenthesis

```php
```

### Horizontal Alignment

### Indentation

#### Breaking Indentation

### Dummy Scopes

## Team Rules

## But What About Markup?
